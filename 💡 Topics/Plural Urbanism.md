### Description
Plural Urbanism is an approach to urban development that emphasizes community-driven, participatory processes in contrast to top-down "smart city" initiatives. It seeks to apply the principles of Plurality to urban planning and governance, focusing on:

1. Collaborative diversity in shaping urban environments
2. Empowering citizens through technology rather than imposing predetermined solutions
3. Balancing technological advancements with democratic governance and citizen participation
4. Addressing urban challenges through inclusive, open-source approaches
5. Fostering urban environments that reflect and serve diverse communities

This approach aims to create more equitable, responsive, and adaptable urban spaces that can accommodate the needs and values of diverse populations.
