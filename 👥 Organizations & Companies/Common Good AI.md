### Works On
Common Good AI is a new nonprofit organization dedicated to building common ground for the common good.  Our vision is for people to co-create breakthrough solutions by transforming how communities solve problems together. With a new form of human-powered AI, we help people collaboratively innovate by empowering groups of any size to debate ideas, identify shared goals, and find an actionable path forward together.  We use new social tools to promote deliberative democracy and civic engagement.
