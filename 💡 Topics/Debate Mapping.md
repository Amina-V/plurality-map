### Description
Debate Mapping is a method of visually organizing and structuring complex arguments, claims, opinions, and evidence on societal issues.

1. Organizing information into formal deliberation structures
2. Addressing cognitive biases and logical pitfalls in argumentation
3. Enabling "societal-scale debate" by comprehensively mapping diverse viewpoints
4. Visualizing the relationships between different arguments and pieces of evidence
5. Facilitating more informed and structured discussions on complex issues
