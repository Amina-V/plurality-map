### Description
Partial Common Ownership is a proposed economic model that aims to balance investment efficiency with allocative efficiency in asset ownership. It addresses the "monopoly problem" of private property by introducing mechanisms that encourage more efficient use of assets while preserving incentives for individual investment. The key component is the Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax (COST), which requires owners to self-assess their assets' value and pay a tax based on that value, while allowing anyone to purchase the asset at the declared price.

Key aspects:
1. Balances investment efficiency and allocative efficiency
2. Draws inspiration from partnership dissolution models like the "Texas Shootout"
3. Implements a COST system to deter monopoly power and create flexible markets
4. Preserves some investment incentives through partial ownership retention
5. Aims to create "Radical Markets" that promote efficient asset use
