- **Community Management**: Leveraging collective effort and expertise to manage community proposals and contributions, providing flexible incentive-based controls for community moderators.
- **Scalable Alignment**: Enabling large-scale consensus-making for complex documents like policies or datasets through market-inspired decision mechanisms.
- **Open-source Governance**: Providing a transparent, no-cost collective governance framework for open-source projects, covering procedures like ticketing, triaging, and merge approvals. Ensuring fair attribution and rewarding of contributors through peer-review and market-inspired mechanisms.
