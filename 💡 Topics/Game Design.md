### Description
Game Design, in the context of Plurality, extends beyond traditional entertainment to encompass the application of game-like mechanisms to address complex societal challenges. It draws from mechanism design in economics, focusing on creating rules and incentives to achieve desired outcomes. Key aspects include:

1. Using game-like systems to model and understand complex social interactions
2. Applying game mechanics to improve decision-making processes (e.g., [[Quadratic Voting]])
3. Leveraging games as tools for social change and experimentation with alternative governance models
4. Utilizing games as immersive learning environments for complex systems
5. Exploring gamification in health and wellness to promote positive behaviors
6. Considering ethical implications of game design in social contexts

See:

- [[Civilization]] game series, particularly the "Gathering Storm" expansion
- [[Minecraft]] as an educational tool
- Research on gamification in health and wellness
