### Description
Quadratic Funding is a mechanism for financing public goods that addresses limitations of traditional funding models. It operates as a matching system where a central funding pool amplifies individual contributions based on a formula that prioritizes projects with broad-based support. This approach harnesses collective intelligence to guide funding allocations, potentially leading to more equitable and diverse resource distribution.

Key aspects:
1. Rooted in the principle of supermodularity, where collaboration yields benefits exceeding the sum of individual contributions.
2. Amplifies smaller contributions, giving greater weight to projects with many small donors.
3. Aims to mitigate wealth inequality in resource allocation and elevate underrepresented voices.
4. Encourages the emergence and support of projects that might not attract traditional funding.
