Their work focuses on using digital technology to support democratic processes and open society principles. Tang advocates for digital democracy, implementing initiatives that aim to increase government transparency, such as publishing recordings and transcripts of official meetings without copyright restrictions. In education, Tang contributed to Taiwan's 12-Year Basic Education Curriculum, which includes digital competence as a core subject, encouraging students to critically engage with media. Tang co-authored the book "Plurality" with Glen Weyl, proposing a social philosophy for the technological age that emphasizes collaboration across social differences.
