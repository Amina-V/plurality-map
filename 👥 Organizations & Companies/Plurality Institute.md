### Works On

Plurality Institute is a 501c3 nonprofit dedicated to fostering human cooperation and progress. We serve as a hub for academics, industry researchers, practitioners, and leaders from both civil and governmental sectors, all of whom are pushing boundaries to reimagine collaborative frameworks.

Our mission is to support and nurture the emerging field of plurality. We facilitate this through hosting both in-person and online events, supporting partner initiatives, sharing pivotal news and research updates, and offering a centralized job and opportunity portal to enhance ecosystem accessibility.

We aim to unify the expertise of stakeholders from a variety of backgroundsâ€”from AI-enhanced democracy, Web3's altruistic potential, to peacekeeping research and cultural bridge-building initiatives.

We strive to operate in alignment with the values of the ecosystem we support, uplifting a variety of approaches and perspectives and fostering connections across the community we serve.
