### Works On
- Developing data science methods based on natural language processing, network science, and machine learning to:
 - Map and analyze communication and interaction in human networks
 - Design tools and field experiments to investigate new forms of human networks
- Applying core research areas of media analytics and design in three ways:
 1. Analyzing large-scale media ecosystems and designing network interventions to encourage new media consumption behavior
 2. Designing and deploying technologies that support children's early literacy through small-scale networks connecting children, parents, and coaches
 3. Developing scalable listening technologies to surface underheard voices and create empathic bridges among communities
- Media analytics research methods:
 - NLP, social network structure, diffusion dynamics, cross-medium interactions
- Media design research methods:  
 - Apps, browser plugins, interactive data visualizations, data-grounded storytelling
- Media and public sphere work:
 - Mapping and understanding public sphere conversation through semantic and network analysis methods
 - Surfacing unheard voices through new research on situated listening and narrative intelligence
 - Creating bridges across political, social, and cultural boundaries through tools designed to create new connections, empathy, and trust among people
