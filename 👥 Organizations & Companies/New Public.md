### Works On
- Creating new digital public spaces where people can thrive and connect
- Bringing together researchers, engineers, designers, and community leaders to reimagine social media
- Focusing on two main strategies:
  1. Helping local communities across America create flourishing digital spaces
  2. Developing prototypes for digital conversation with public service media organizations
- Believing that the design of public spaces shapes the public conversations and communities, and that current dominant social media platforms are tearing at the social fabric
- Aiming to create technologies that can understand intent and context and smoothly adapt to transform how individuals engage with machines, data, and each other
- Conducting research and discovery to spread the word and build out a field committed to healthy digital public spaces
