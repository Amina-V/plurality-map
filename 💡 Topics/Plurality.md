### Description
Plurality (â¿») is a socio-technical concept advocating for the use of technology to empower collaboration and manage diversity in society. It comprises three core components:
1. Descriptive: Recognizes society as composed of diverse, intersecting groups
2. Normative: Emphasizes diversity as a driver of social progress
3. Prescriptive: Advocates for technology design to facilitate collaboration across differences

Plurality aims to create a richer, pluralistic ecosystem called "[[Decentralized Society (DeSoc)]]", where individuals and communities co-create plural network goods and intelligences at various scales.
