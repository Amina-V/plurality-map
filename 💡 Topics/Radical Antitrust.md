### Description
Radical Antitrust is an approach that goes beyond traditional antitrust measures to address the broader issue of interconnected ownership and control in the economy. It recognizes the limitations of conventional antitrust laws in dealing with the rise of institutional investors and the phenomenon of common ownership. Key aspects include:

1. Addressing the problem of common ownership by institutional investors across competing firms.
2. Proposing restrictions on diversification within industries for institutional investors.
3. Extending antitrust considerations to tackle monopsony power in labor markets.
4. Aiming to restore competitive incentives and promote fair competition across entire industries.
